# 11ty3 Vanilla
A simple 11ty3 starter with no over complications.
---

Clone, then:

```bash
pnpm i
```
To launch the dev server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

To build the site:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

This will generate the `_site` folder with the built site. CSS and JS will be minified and bundled by esbuild and lightningcss.

## Why?

I had another 11ty starter (Tadam) with a lot of things included in it, and realized it can be overkill and bloated. This is a simpler version of the same thing, with just the bare minimum.

Things like a collection of filters, shortcodes, CDN libraries snippets or other usefull related things will be added to a separate repo. Copy/Paste is still king sometimes.
