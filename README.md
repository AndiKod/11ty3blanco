# Blanco
A simple, blank, 11ty3 starter with no over complications.

---

Clone the repo, then:

```bash
pnpm i
```
Fire the dev server on localhost:8080:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

To build the site:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

This will generate the `_site` folder with the built site. CSS and JS will be minified and bundled by esbuild and lightningcss.

## Why?

Sometime you just need a clean start and build on top of it. This starter is a good choice if you want to start a new project from scratch without any opinionated setup.

For code snippets and example implementation of things like blog parts, plugins, external data, etc.check out the "opt-out" version of this starter at [https://github.com/AndiKod/tadam11ty](https://github.com/AndiKod/tadam11ty).
